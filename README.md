**Turn your Discord conversations into organized Obsidian notes automatically.**

## Features

### üí¨ **Automatic Discord message saving**
- Automatically save messages from specified Discord channels to Obsidian notes
- Real-time message synchronization

### üéÆ **Discord slash commands**
- `/createnote` - Create new notes
- `/listnote` - Display note list
- `/outputnote` - Output note contents to Discord
- `/setnote` - Change message save destination

### üîß **Settings and security**

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get your Discord bot ready
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) ‚Üí "New Application"
2. Create a bot and copy the **Bot Token** and **Application ID**
3. Invite the bot to your server with [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=2048&scope=bot%20applications.commands) (replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID)

### Step 2: Configure the plugin
1. Install the plugin in Obsidian
2. Paste your **Bot Token** and **Client ID** in settings
3. Add your **Discord User ID** (right-click your name in Discord ‚Üí Copy User ID)
4. Set which **channel** to monitor and which **note** to save to

That's it! Messages from your chosen channel will now appear in your Obsidian note.

## Available Commands

Type these in Discord after setup:

- `/setnote path:My Research Notes` - Change where messages are saved
- `/createnote name:Team Meeting Jan 15` - Create a new note
- `/listnote` - See all your notes
- `/outputnote note_path:Project Status` - Share a note with your Discord channel

## Security & Privacy

**Data Handling:**
- Bot tokens and client IDs are stored locally in Obsidian with Base64 encoding
- No data is sent to external servers except Discord's official APIs
- Only messages from the configured channel are processed
- User authentication prevents unauthorized command usage

**Permissions:**
- The bot only requires minimal Discord permissions: Send Messages and Use Slash Commands
- Bot cannot read DMs unless explicitly configured
- Plugin operates entirely within your local Obsidian vault

**Best Practices:**
- Keep your bot token secure and never share it
- Regularly review configured channels and user permissions
- Use a dedicated Discord server for testing if needed

## Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond to commands?**
- Make sure your Discord User ID matches what you put in settings
- Check the bot has permissions in your server

**Messages not saving?**
- Verify the channel ID is correct (right-click channel ‚Üí Copy Channel ID)
- Make sure the note path exists or the plugin can create it

**Need help?**
- Check the console (Ctrl+Shift+I) for error messages
- Try the refresh button in Obsidian's toolbar
